<!-- Que-4  Canvas and SVG tags 

Ans- <canvas> Tag:
The <canvas> element is used for drawing graphics, such as shapes, images, and animations, using JavaScript. It provides a bitmap-based rendering context where you can draw pixels directly. It's well-suited for dynamic and interactive graphics. -->

<canvas id="myCanvas" width="300" height="150"></canvas>

<script>
  var canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
  var ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");

  ctx.fillStyle = "lightblue";
  ctx.fillRect(50, 25, 200, 100);
</script>

<!-- In this example, we create a canvas with a width of 300 pixels and a height of 150 pixels. The JavaScript code uses the 2D rendering context (getContext("2d")) to draw a filled rectangle on the canvas. -->

<!-- <svg> Tag:
    The <svg> element is used for creating scalable vector graphics. SVG is an XML-based markup language that describes two-dimensional vector graphics. It's well-suited for static graphics and illustrations and can be easily styled and manipulated using CSS and JavaScript -->

        <svg width="300" height="150">
            <rect x="50" y="25" width="200" height="100" fill="lightgreen" />
          </svg>

          <!-- In this example, we use the <rect> element within the <svg> element to draw a rectangle. The attributes of the <rect> element specify its position, size, and fill color. -->
    
            <!-- Choosing between <canvas> and <svg>:
                Use <canvas> when:
                
                You need a pixel-based drawing surface.
                You are creating complex animations or interactive graphics.
                Performance is crucial for your application.
                Use <svg> when:
                
                You want to create scalable and resolution-independent graphics.
                Graphics are more static and don't require frequent updates.
                You need to manipulate and style the graphics using CSS. -->
